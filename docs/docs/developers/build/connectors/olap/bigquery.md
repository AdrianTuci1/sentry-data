[Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs) is a fully managed, serverless data warehouse that enables scalable and cost-effective analysis of large datasets. Parrot supports connecting to BigQuery as a live connector, allowing you to build metrics views and dashboards directly on top of existing BigQuery tables — no data movement required.

:::tip BigQuery as a Live Connector vs. Data Source Connector
Parrot supports BigQuery in two distinct modes:

- **OLAP (Live Connector)** — Parrot queries BigQuery directly at dashboard load time. No data is ingested into Parrot. Use this when your data is already modeled and optimized in BigQuery and you want Parrot as a visual layer on top. Set `olap_connector: bigquery` in `statsparrot.yaml`.

- **Data Source Connector** — Parrot extracts data from BigQuery and ingests it into its embedded engine (DuckDB or ClickHouse). Use this when you want Parrot to manage the data pipeline, apply transformations via SQL models, or combine BigQuery data with other sources. See the [BigQuery data source docs](/developers/build/connectors/data-source/bigquery).

In general, use the live connector if your BigQuery tables are already production-ready and large. Use data source ingestion if you need to transform, join, or enrich the data before building dashboards.

## Connect to BigQuery

After selecting "Add Data", select BigQuery and fill in your connection parameters. This will automatically create the `bigquery.yaml` file in your `connectors` directory and populate the `.env` file with your credentials.

For more information on supported parameters, see our [BigQuery connector YAML reference docs](/reference/project-files/connectors#bigquery).

```yaml
type: connector
driver: bigquery

project_id: "my-gcp-project"
google_application_credentials: "{{ .env.GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS }}"
```

:::tip Creating a Service Account
For production use, authenticate with a Google Cloud service account JSON key. The service account needs the `roles/bigquery.dataViewer`, `roles/bigquery.readSessionUser`, and `roles/bigquery.jobUser` roles. See [the appendix in the BigQuery data source docs](/developers/build/connectors/data-source/bigquery#how-to-create-a-service-account-using-the-google-cloud-console) for a step-by-step guide.

### Application Default Credentials (Local Development)

For local development, you can omit `google_application_credentials` and Parrot will use your local Google Cloud CLI credentials:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

```yaml
type: connector
driver: bigquery

project_id: "my-gcp-project"
```

:::warning Not suitable for Parrot Cloud
Application Default Credentials only work locally. When deploying to Parrot Cloud, always provide a service account JSON via `google_application_credentials`.
:::

### Controlling Query Costs

BigQuery bills based on bytes scanned. On the on-demand pricing model, we recommend setting `max_bytes_billed` on the connector to cap the amount scanned per dashboard query. Queries that exceed the limit fail with an error instead of running.

```yaml
type: connector
driver: bigquery

project_id: "my-gcp-project"
google_application_credentials: "{{ .env.GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS }}"
max_bytes_billed: 100000000000 # 100 GB
```

`max_bytes_billed` only applies to live connector dashboard queries. It is not enforced when ingesting data via the BigQuery data source connector. The default value of `0` disables the limit.

## Build a Metrics View on BigQuery

Once connected, set BigQuery as the OLAP connector in your `statsparrot.yaml`:

```yaml
olap_connector: bigquery
```

Then create a metrics view that references a BigQuery table:

```yaml
type: metrics_view

connector: bigquery
database: my-gcp-project    # BigQuery project (optional; defaults to the connector's project_id)
database_schema: my_dataset # BigQuery dataset
model: my_table

timeseries: created_at
dimensions:
  - column: region
  - column: category
measures:
  - name: total_revenue
    expression: SUM(revenue)
```

In BigQuery terminology, `database` maps to the **project**, `database_schema` maps to the **dataset**, and `model` maps to the **table**. Measure expressions must use [BigQuery SQL](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax) syntax.

:::note
Parrot supports metrics views directly on BigQuery as a live connector. Incremental models and partitioned ingestion are not supported in live connector mode.
:::

To reduce bytes scanned on dashboards with repeat traffic, see [Caching query results](/developers/build/metrics-view/underlying-model#caching-query-results) on live connectors. Caching pairs well with [`max_bytes_billed`](#controlling-query-costs) — use both to cap per-query cost and reduce overall query volume.
